# BasicRoboticsTechnologies
This is a repository in order to help someone who would like to implement a robotic technique with c++. 
And it is for relearning their technologies to me.

# How to compile
```
$ cd <path_to_repository>/BasicRoboticsTechnologies/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

# Installation of requirements in Ubuntu
## Compiler
* A C++17 compiler

## Linear Alebra Calculation
* Eigen3 <br>

  now planning to use it instead of GNUPLOT (still studying...)
